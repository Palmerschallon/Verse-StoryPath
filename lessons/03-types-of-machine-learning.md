## The Tale of the Many Ways to Learn

Word spread about Mira's learning machines, and soon people asked her a deeper question:

“Do all machines learn the same way?”

Mira shook her head.

“Learning depends on what you already know.”

Supervised learning

Sometimes, villagers brought baskets that held both the facts and the answers.

Weather and sales.
Measurements and risk.
Flipper lengths and species.

Mira called this supervised learning — because the answers were present while the machine learned. From these pairs, the machine learned how features relate to outcomes so it could predict answers for the future.

There were two kinds of supervised learning.

Regression

When the answers were numbers — cones sold, house prices, miles-per-gallon —
the machine learned to predict a value.

This was called regression.

Classification

When the answers were categories — at-risk or not, default or not, Adelie or Gentoo or Chinstrap —
the machine learned to choose a class.

Sometimes there were only two choices.
This was binary classification.

Sometimes there were several.
This was multiclass classification.

And sometimes, more than one answer could be true — like a movie that could be both science fiction and comedy. Mira smiled and called this multilabel classification.

Unsupervised learning

But not every basket had answers.

Sometimes the villagers only brought features — the size and petals of flowers, the habits of customers — and simply asked:

“What belongs together?”

For this, Mira used unsupervised learning.

The most common method was clustering — letting the machine group things based on similarity alone. No one told it what the groups meant. The groups revealed themselves.

Later, people often named those groups — and sometimes used those names to train supervised models in the future.

The moral

Mira taught:

“When you already know the answers, teach the machine to follow them.”

“When you don’t, let the machine reveal the patterns that were there all along.”

And the villagers learned that choosing the right kind of learning
was itself
a form of wisdom.
