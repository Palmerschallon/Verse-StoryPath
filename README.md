# Machine Learning as Stories

Machine learning can feel abstract, mathematical, or distant.  
This project offers an alternate path in — **through story.**

Each lesson here retells a core machine-learning concept as a narrative.  
These are not replacements for formal instruction — they are **doorways** into intuition, imagination, and understanding.

Perfect for:
- beginners
- visual + narrative thinkers
- people learning ML from non-technical backgrounds
- teachers + mentors introducing concepts gently

Then, when you're ready, you can step into the more formal learning paths with confidence.

## 🌉 Lesson 1 — The Bridge-Builders

Machine learning lives where **data science** and **software engineering** meet.

Data science listens to the past.  
Software engineering carries that wisdom into tools and systems that live in the world.  
Machine learning is the **bridge between them.**
